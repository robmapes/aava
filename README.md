AAVA TECHNOLOGY

Website Project, 2023

Replace existing WordPress website with a static site written in standard HTML and CSS. AAVA wants a website that is useful only when pointing a potential customer to the site. Having a WordPress site, one that needs maintaining due to updates to WordPress, the template, PHP, and miscellaneous plug-ins, it is better to have a static site that needs minimal maintenance.
